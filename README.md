# 100 New Projects ðŸš€

I am embarking on a new series called **100 New Projects** to overcome my laziness and enhance my **UI/UX** and **backend development** skills. Through this journey, I aim to stay consistent, explore new technologies, and sharpen my problem-solving abilities. ðŸ’ª

## Project 1: BMI Calculator ðŸ§®

This is my first project in the **100 New Projects** series. I'm building a **BMI Calculator** to help users determine their Body Mass Index based on their weight and height. This tool offers a simple way to monitor fitness levels. While working on this project, I'm focusing on improving my **UI/UX design skills** to create an intuitive and engaging user experience. ðŸŽ¨

Stay tuned for more exciting projects! ðŸŒŸ
